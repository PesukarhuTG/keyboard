# RSS Virtual Keyboard

### Description
A study project, task [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/virtual-keyboard/virtual-keyboard-en.md).<br>
So, we need to create a virtual Keyboard with several tasks:
- all the necessary elements are generated with the usage of JS
- pressing a key on a physical keyboard highlights the key on the virtual keyboard
- if buttons are pressed, all the pressed buttons are highlighted on the virtual keyboard
- the virtual keyboard is able to switch between two language layouts
- clicks on the buttons with a mouse on the virtual keyboard and pressing keys on a physical keyboard should input symbols to the text area located on the page above the virtual keyboard
